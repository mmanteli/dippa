History: type 2 diabetes mellitus since the age of 30, chronic renal insufficiency for 2 years, treated with haemodialysis. He had undergone supracondylar amputation of the right pelvic limb 4 years earlier.
Physical examination: Physical examination revealed a hypochromic, hypothermic glans penis with a necrotic lesion of approximately 1.5 cm on the ventral side, as well as transurethral purulent discharge and induration of the distal third of the penile shaft.
